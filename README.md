title of the paper: Bridging Model-Based and Learned Control: GRU Networks as Policy and Dynamics Surrogates in MPC-Guided Greenhouse Systems
Here is a breakdown of the experimental steps to run your greenhouse control experiment combining MPC with the Van Henten model and GRU networks:

    Model Setup

        Define the greenhouse climate dynamics using the Van Henten model.

        Formulate the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem based on this model, including state and input constraints and an objective function related to climate control and energy use.

    MPC Policy Generation

        Implement the MPC controller to generate control policies for greenhouse environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, CO2) over a chosen prediction horizon.

        Run simulation or real data experiments where MPC controls the greenhouse, and collect state, control input, and resulting environmental data.

    GRU Training for Policy Learning

        Use the collected data (states and MPC-generated control actions) to train a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network to learn the MPC control policy directly, thus approximating the policy in a data-driven manner.

        conduct the cross validation to find the best hyperparameters for the GRU model.

        conduct the generalization test to evaluate the performance of the GRU model.

    GRU Training for Dynamics Modeling

        Using the same GRU architecture, train another model to learn the greenhouse dynamics (state transitions) from the collected data to serve as a surrogate model of the Van Henten dynamics.

        conduct the cross validation to find the best hyperparameters for the GRU model.

        conduct the generalization test to evaluate the performance of the GRU model.

    Surrogate MPC Implementation

        Replace the original Van Henten model in the MPC formulation with the GRU-based surrogate dynamics model.

        Recompute control policies using this surrogate MPC.

    Comparison and Evaluation

        Compare the control policies generated by:

            Original MPC using Van Henten model

            Learned GRU policy approximating MPC control

            MPC using GRU surrogate dynamics

        Evaluate performance metrics such as control accuracy, energy consumption, computational efficiency, and robustness.

This structured experiment will allow you to assess the viability of learning-based control and surrogate modeling approaches in greenhouse climate regulation against a model-based MPC baseline and analyze trade-offs in accuracy and computation.

Experimental Steps for GRU-Based Predictive Control vs TD3

    Data Collection and Environment Setup

        Collect greenhouse climate data or simulate using a validated model such as Van Henten's.

        Establish the environment including state variables (temperature, humidity, CO2) and control inputs.

    GRU-Based Predictive Control Implementation

        Train a GRU neural network to model greenhouse dynamics based on historical and simulation data.

        Integrate the trained GRU model within an MPC framework to predict future states and compute optimal control actions over a horizon.

        Implement the MPC scheme with the GRU surrogate model to generate control policies.

    TD3 Reinforcement Learning Implementation

        Define state and action spaces matching those in the GRU-MPC setup.

        Design a reward function balancing greenhouse climate regulation and energy use.

        Train a TD3 agent in simulation to learn an optimal control policy directly from environment interaction, without explicit dynamics.

    Policy Deployment and Data Collection

        Run greenhouse simulations or real experiments under control of the GRU-MPC policy and the TD3 agent separately.

        Collect performance data including climate variables, control inputs, energy consumption, and robustness to disturbances.

    Performance Comparison

        Analyze control accuracy in achieving target climate conditions.

        Evaluate computational efficiency and real-time applicability of each method.

        Assess robustness against environmental changes or noise.

        Compare energy efficiency and resource usage.

        Discuss interpretability and ease of deployment.
